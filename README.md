# QUESTION ONE

Socks match - there is a large pile of socks that must be paired by color. given an array of integers representing the color of each sock, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
Code works in a java compiler like intellij idea tested and sure

# QUESTION TWO

 A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elernents 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] then the array would become [3, 4, 5, 1, 2). Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.
 Given an array a of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

# QUESTION THREE

 Given a reference to the head of a doubly-linked list and an integer, data, create a new DoublyLinkedListNode object having data value data and insert it at the proper location to maintain the sort.

# QUESTION FOUR

 You are given pointer to the root of the binary search tree and two values vl and v2. You need to return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of vl and v2 in the binary search tree.

# QUESTION FIVE
 In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then process q queries, where each query is one of the following 3 types:
 1.1 x: Enqueue element z into the end of the queue. 2. 2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue. 3.3: Print the element at the front of the queue.
